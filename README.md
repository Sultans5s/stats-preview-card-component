## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was a great challenge to start with, Easy to follow instructions. I can't wait to seek othor challenges.

the major highlit for this challenge is:

```css
.right-container {

    background-color: #AB5CDB;

}

.heading-image {

    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
    opacity: 0.75;

}
```

Basically, it's blend the background color with the image adding accent color.

### Continued development

My plan is to cuntinuing improve skills by doing more challenges and add frameworks best practices to my work flow.

### Useful resources
